# Predictive Maintenance Model

## Overview
This repository demonstrates how to build a simple predictive maintenance model using synthetic data. The goal is to classify whether equipment requires maintenance based on sensor readings and operating conditions. By analyzing patterns in the data, the model can alert maintenance teams before failures occur, reducing downtime and costs.

## Features
- **Synthetic dataset**: The Python script generates a mock dataset with features such as temperature, vibration, pressure, and a binary label indicating whether maintenance is needed.
- **Data preparation**: Includes steps for data cleaning, train–test split, and feature scaling to prepare data for modeling.
- **Logistic regression classifier**: Implements a logistic regression model using scikit‑learn to predict maintenance needs.
- **Model evaluation**: Prints performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess model effectiveness.
- **Reusable script**: The analysis is contained in a single file (`predictive_maintenance_model.py`) that can be adapted to real datasets.

## Repository Structure
- `predictive_maintenance_model.py`: Generates synthetic data, trains a logistic regression model, and prints evaluation metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3 (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit‑learn)
- Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration


## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/ray1131313131/predictive-maintenance-model
   cd predictive-maintenance-model
2. **Install dependencies**:
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
3. **Run the script**:
   python predictive_maintenance_model.py
   The script will output model performance metrics to the console.

## Why This Project
Predictive maintenance leverages data to anticipate equipment failures before they happen, saving time and resources. This project provides a simple, reproducible example of building a classification model for maintenance needs, which can be extended to real-world datasets.
